[22:37] sudo rm -rf /: Hey guys - echoing what I just wrote in #api , looking to write a bot for Discord in C# but I have no idea where to begin - a lot of the stuff out there seems a little dated
[22:37] sudo rm -rf /: Can you guys point me in the right direction?
[22:38] sudo rm -rf /: Will pay for assistance in memes
[22:38] Emzi × Emzi 👑: The best place to start is docs
[22:39] Emzi × Emzi 👑: //tag docs
[22:39] Flamanis: The best place to start is seppuku

[22:39] Emzi × Emzi 👑: That said I recommend you start with nightlies, will save you some headaches in the long run
[22:39] Emzi × Emzi 👑: Uh
[22:39] Emzi × Emzi 👑: I forgot
[22:40] Emzi × Emzi 👑: Whatever it's in the docs
[22:40] sudo rm -rf /: Hehe, nah all g - I've got you
[22:40] BOTRunning on 90% Emzi's Code: ​​​Documentation for the library is available over at:
- 3.2: https://dsharpplus.emzi0767.com/
- 4.0: https://dsharpplus.github.io/
[22:40] Flamanis: And that's why D.Net is better
[22:40] Flamanis: :stuck_out_tongue:
[22:41] sudo rm -rf /: Is there any good example code you can recommend too?
[22:41] Emzi × Emzi 👑: Nah I just have my head in different things
[22:41] Flamanis: Oh, do tell :wink:

[22:41] BOTRunning on 90% Emzi's Code: ​wrong channel buddy. this channel is for DSharpPlus. You'll want to go to #deleted-channel for Discord.NET. ( They have cake over there ;p )
[22:41] Emzi × Emzi 👑: You can use these tags
[22:41] Flamanis: Deleted channel
[22:41] Flamanis: Bro
[22:41] Flamanis: Have you not updated that tag since the purge?
[22:42] Emzi × Emzi 👑: More or less
[22:42] Flamanis: Jeez
[22:42] Emzi × Emzi 👑: But then the other channel doesn't even have one
[22:42] Emzi × Emzi 👑: :thinkderp:
[22:42] sudo rm -rf /: :squirtheh:
[22:43] Emzi × Emzi 👑: Anyways you should try consulting the docs of either lib and deciding what you prefer
[22:43] sudo rm -rf /: Yeah nah, defs will do
[22:43] Flamanis: I'll be honest, Emzi is probably a good judge of differences between the two
[22:43] sudo rm -rf /: Cheers for that!
[22:43] Flamanis: He was one of the 'support staff' if you can call us people that in the other one as well
[22:43] Emzi × Emzi 👑: I mean what's there to tell, both achieve same things in different ways
[22:43] Flamanis: Then he turned traitor
[22:44] Emzi × Emzi 👑: D#+ is more user-friendly, whereas D.Net is considered more mature(edited)
[22:44] Flamanis: PRAISE TREES
[22:44] Flamanis: PRAISE BEES AND BIRDS AND FLOWERS
[22:44] Flamanis: Y'know, nature
😂

[22:44] Emzi × Emzi 👑: I mean I moved here because I realized I could help here more
[22:45] Flamanis: I'll be honest sudo, I know D.Net, I don't know D#+. But if the attitude over in D.Net is the same as when I left, probably nicer here
[22:45] Emzi × Emzi 👑: People are nicer now
[22:45] Flamanis: Althought I was like 40% of that
[22:45] Emzi × Emzi 👑: At least a bit
[22:45] Emzi × Emzi 👑: Stillu is doing docs too
[22:46] Flamanis: On which?
[22:46] Emzi × Emzi 👑: D.Net
[22:46] Flamanis: Wow
[22:46] Emzi × Emzi 👑: He basically overhauled them
[22:46] Emzi × Emzi 👑: To an extent
[22:46] Flamanis: Good for him man, it's nice that others are contributing(edited)
[22:46] Emzi × Emzi 👑: Got a prof for that
[22:46] sudo rm -rf /: Hmm, righto
[22:47] Flamanis: That being said, if I were to pick back up in C# bot making, I'd probably take the time to learn this one. Probably best not to talk to fox lest I piss him off somehow
[22:47] Emzi × Emzi 👑: I think both libs are more or less in the same place in many aspects
[22:48] Emzi × Emzi 👑: I also started making my own
[22:48] sudo rm -rf /: Yeah fair, looking through they seem fairly similar
[22:48] Flamanis: I should probably actually look at the source
[22:49] sudo rm -rf /: What's the rationale behind the one you're making @Emzi × Emzi 👑 btw?
[22:49] Emzi × Emzi 👑: I think the only thing we have that D.Net only has via third-parties is Lavalink
[22:49] Flamanis: Let's hope it doesn't go the way of Finite's lib
[22:50] Flamanis: Last message there, july 4th by me
[22:50] Monika: huh
[22:50] Emzi × Emzi 👑: Well there's 3 reasons:
1. Both D.Net and D#+ are fairly similar and I wanted to do something different with a different approach
2. I wanted to prove to myself that I can
3. I started making my own JSON serialiser because I figured I might as well make something faster than JSON.NET(edited)
[22:50] Monika: use wumpus.net instead flam :^)
[22:51] sudo rm -rf /: Oman, all these flavours, not enough tongues to try em all
[22:51] Flamanis: Go away finite
[22:51] Monika: i'll show you the best stuff to do with wumpus.net :^)
[22:51] Monika: oof
[22:51] Flamanis: Tongues, now you're talking my language sudo
👅

[22:51] Monika: o w o
[22:52] Emzi × Emzi 👑: Anyways the library I'm making will be using MS abstractions for a number of things, and will be more DI-integrated
[22:52] Flamanis: Heh
[22:52] Flamanis: I'm working on a commands manager for Discordia
[22:52] Flamanis: Or well, overhauling my old version and properly documenting shit
[22:52] Emzi × Emzi 👑: To what extent I am not sure yet, but I was thinking of basically providing modularity via DI
[22:53] Emzi × Emzi 👑: Basically something more scalable
[22:53] Monika: so it'll work really well with Finite.Commands? :smile:
[22:53] Emzi × Emzi 👑: If it provides a universal interface, why not
[22:53] Flamanis: Finite, you break EVERYTHING
[22:54] Flamanis: What makes you think it'll play nice
[22:54] Monika: @Flamanis I don't break Finite.Commands at least :wink:
[22:54] Flamanis: With your bomb waiting to happen
[22:54] Emzi × Emzi 👑: I'll most likely also provide a CNext-like framework to boot
[22:54] sudo rm -rf /: Is that just for the sake of self-learning?
[22:54] sudo rm -rf /: Seems like a proper undertaking
[22:54] Emzi × Emzi 👑: That and maybe I'll apply for channel here
[22:54] Emzi × Emzi 👑: Who knows
[22:55] Flamanis: Oh boy, you'll turn traitor on two C# channels
[22:55] sudo rm -rf /: Haha
[22:55] Flamanis: @voltania banarino
[22:55] Flamanis: :stuck_out_tongue:

[22:55] Flamanis: Who wants to ping b1nzy
[22:55] Emzi × Emzi 👑: I'll prolly still help out here too
[22:55] Flamanis: Don't actually ping him
[22:56] Flamanis: In case you thought of doing it, he's a discord dev who likes to properly banarino you for pinging him
